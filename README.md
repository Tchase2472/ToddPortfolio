# Todd Chase Code
A little about me: I was a senior counsellor for a church for nearly 20 years. 
I suddenly found myself unable to continue with that career path. So, I opted to learn software development.
As you can imagine, it has not been an easy road. I have been at it almost 2 years now. 
In that time I have learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, C++, BASH, Git and GitHub. I have been exposed to SQL, Ruby, and PHP.
However, I not proficient in these. Given sufficient time, I can work with them however.
Currently, I have working on mastering React. Subsequently, I hope to learn Ruby (fully), and Rails.

I am not looking to be the next software development pordigy. I would be very content to operate as a junior developer that has
an opportunity to learn. I have found in my studies that the classroom and the workplace are very different arenas. The coursework 
is only the beginning regardless of how much time one has spent on it. 

I chose software development because I find the subject intensly interesting. I learn something new everyday. Literally, every day. 
I suspect I will continue to do so for the rest of my career. 

Thank you for your time reading this.

Sincerely,
Todd Chase
